    "We suppose that Wikipedia is facing the common problem as pages in Google. Highly popular articles are popular also because they have a lot of backlinks or pages that are redirected to them. Imagine you're a journalist or a active blogger writing about an article on Afghanistan news. You google and enter the `Afghanistan` article on Wikipedia to get the resources quickly. Entering wikipedia articles through search engines such as Google can be tricky because even if it yields decent amount of content, you will never find a Wikipedia page that does not come up, i.e. that isn't popular enough. Once you find enough content on Wikipedia, you'll return to your adored search engine. So, why would you keep searching for that `inexistent` page? \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to showcase articles which may be less popular so that you can be informed by facts and topics you may search or need. Also, for a journalist, it may really be helpful because instead of covering incredibly adverstised topics, they may get the opportunity to be the first to right their own story about an uncovered subject. Their research can improve the article visibility and give more importance to a hidden world.\n",
